# About

My name is Matthew Clark.  I am recent graduate in Computer Science from the [University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT)][1].  I am currently living in the Greater Toronto Area in Canada.

I have a passion for new technology and enjoy discussing new trends with anybody.  My focus when trying to create new software and technology is education technology, I would like to work on software that will be used in classrooms to improve the learning environment. 

I have worked on many projects in many different languages, currently my favorite are web based technologies specifically JavaScript, CSS and HTML.  I also have experience creating applications on the mobile platform specifically Android and Windows 8.  I do however have experience with ASP.NET, C#, XAML, Java, C++, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git for version control.  Currently my preferred text editor is vim.

I enjoy programming and have taken part in many Hackathons, I always like working with people and learning new things.
