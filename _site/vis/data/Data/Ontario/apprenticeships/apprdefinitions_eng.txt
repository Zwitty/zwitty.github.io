A program participant is an individual who is active in an apprenticeship training program for a specific trade. To be included in the count, program participants must have a training agreement with a sponsor that is currently registered with the Ministry or was in a registered status within the last 12 months. Program participants currently without registered training agreements are usually between apprenticeship jobs or attending classroom training. 
A sponsor is responsible for an apprentice’s on-the-job training. Sponsors are typically employers, unions or local apprenticeship committees. Because one sponsor may sponsor apprentices in multiple trades, this column cannot be summed to arrive at the total number of unique apprenticeship sponsors. 
Training delivery agents (TDAs) are approved by the Ministry to deliver the classroom training component of apprenticeship programs. Because one TDA may deliver classroom training for multiple trades, this column cannot be summed to arrive at the total number of unique TDAs.
